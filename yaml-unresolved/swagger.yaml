                       A job consists of one or more tasks. For example, the example shown inludes an import, conversion, and a export task. Task names should only contain alphanumerals, dash (-), and underscore (_).
            
                        Each task must specify an <code>operation</code> which is used to route the task to an API endpoint. The example shown lists 3 tasks with <code>import/upload</code>, <code>convert</code>, and <code>export/url</code> operations.
              example:   
                tag: 'custom-tag'
                tasks: {
                  "my-upload-1": {

        This method is not recommended since your system may timeout the request for jobs that takes a long time to complete (i.e. large video conversions). Please note that we may also queue your jobs when our systems are busy.
        
        Instead, use webhooks to receive notification of job completion or error.

        Block the request until the task status is <code>success</code> or <code>failed</code>. 
        
        This method is not recommended since your system may timeout the request for tasks that takes a long time to complete (i.e. large video conversions). We may also queue your tasks when our systems are busy.
        
        Instead, use webhooks to receive notification of task completion or error.
